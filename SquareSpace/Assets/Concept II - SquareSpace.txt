Game Mechanics:

	- Obstacles 

	- Weaponary

	- Proccedurally Generated Levels

	- Enemies

	- Score System and Level Management

	- Pickup Items and Upgrade System

Obstacles: 

	4 types of Obstacles:

		1. Normal Wall - A wall that does not move, but can be destroyed by the Player's weapon (HP = 150).

		*All other walls are invulnable to the Player's Weapon
		
		2. Horizontally Moving Wall - A wall that moves from left to right in a consistent pattern

		3. Vertically Moving Wall - A wall that moves up and returns back down in a consistent pattern

		4. Void Wall - A wall that appears and disappears at a set time. When these types of walls disappear, 
			the player can pass through them like they are not there.

Weaponary:

	Player's Weapon - A gun that aims toward where the player's mouse is.

	Weapon Stats:
	
		Damage = 50

		Rate of Fire = 20 rounds per minute (3 second reload)

		Projectile Speed = Depends if Hitscan weapons are viable

		Starting Ammo = 40 rounds

		Max Ammo = Infinte


Enemies:

	4 types of enemies that spawn along the same x cooridnates as the walls (each wall will have an enemy to ethier side of it)

	Enemy 1 = Static Enemy - Enemy doesnt move (HP = 100, Diamond Gain = 2)
	
	Enemy 2 = Horizontal Enemy - Enemy moves side to side (Left and Right)  similar to the walls (HP = 150, Diamond Gain = 4)

	Enemy 3 = Vertical Enemy - Enemy moves up and down similar to walls (HP = 200, Diamond Gain = 6)

	Enemy 4 = Void Enemy - same behaviour as walls, expect they will move side to side like the horizontal enemy (HP = 250, Diamond Gain = 8)

	On which side of the wall enemies spawn on will be random as well

	


Proccedurally Generated Levels:

	Each Level with have a set length with random obstacles that are proceedurally generated 

		Level 1 = Length: 500, Obstacle Count = 10
		
		Level 2 = Length: 1000, Obstacle Count = 20

		Level 3 = Length: 1500, Obstacle Count = 30

	All Obstacles will be 50 meters away from each other.

	All Bullets and Powerups will spawn inbetween the Obstacles (25 m from each obstacle).
